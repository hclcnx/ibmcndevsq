# IBM Cloud Connections Styling v1.5.0

### Getting started
The default theme of IBM Connections is not entirely in alignment with Sanquin's style guide . Luckily does IBM offer the possibility to deliver custom stylesheets.

### Requirements
 To work on this project, you'll need the following software:
  - SCSS compiler
  - an IDE
  - Stylish (this plugin is used to test the .css files)
  - GreaseMonkey (this plugin is used to test .js files)

### Project Structure
//TBD

### Workflow
Once the changes has been pushed to the master branch, one can open a pull request. The changes will become visible when the pull request is merged.
